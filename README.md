# Apnic Challenge

This project was generated with [Angular CLI] version 9.1.8.

## Pre-compiled Code

For your convenience, the compiled code is included in this repository.
To run, copy the contents of the [/dist] folder to a web server (online, or local), and open the index.html file.
Due to CORS, you cannot open the site using the local file system (file:///). It must be served over http or https.

## Wordpress?

I don't usually use WordPress, other than helping out designers with some functionality. So for the purposes of this challenge I have stuck with my familiar tools of Angular and Bootstrap, so I can show off my functionality and design capabilities.

## Development Server

To run the code locally, you will require NPM and Angular to be installed. Run `npm install` to install the node dependencies.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Alternatively, run `ng serve -o` to start the dev server and open a web browser automatically with the site loaded for you.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
